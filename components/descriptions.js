      "My desktop version of Zynga's Boggle With Friends, coded entirely with HTML, CSS and object-oriented JavaScript.

      'A MERN stack app that allows users to add and review hawker stalls, to help resolve the perennial question â€” "What\'s for lunch?". It is deployed via Netlify, Heroku and MongoDB Atlas. Authentication / authorisation was implemented with JWTs, and we also configured Cloudinary to enable users to upload photos. Last but not least, this group project was invaluable in helping us learn about Git workflows.',
